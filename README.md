# DIY No-sew Guitar Straps

This site covers making your own guitar straps. The inspiration for this was to make straps that were shorter and worked well with Strangberg guitars when worn in the classical position. However, they should work with any guitar and be customizable.

Goals of this project are:

* Do not require sewing.
* Prefer to use off the shelf componet that are cheap and easy to obtain.
* Avoid using expensive or unique tools.
* Avoid requiring 3D printed parts.
* Allow for easy customization and sizing.
* Be as comfortable as possible.
* Does not scratch or damage the guitar.
* Stays on the guitar and does not result in the guitar getting dropped.

[Version 001](/v001/README.md) is about 95% of what you want a guitar strap to be.
