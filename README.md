# DIY No-sew Guitar Straps

This site covers making your own guitar straps. The inspiration for this was to make straps that were shorter and worked well with Strandberg guitars when worn in the classical position. However, they should work with any guitar and be customizable.

Goals of this project are:

* Do not require sewing.
* Prefer to use off the shelf componet that are cheap and easy to obtain.
* Avoid using expensive or unique tools.
* Avoid requiring 3D printed parts.
* Allow for easy customization and sizing.
* Be as comfortable as possible.
* Does not scratch or damage the guitar.
* Stays on the guitar and does not result in the guitar getting dropped.

[Version 001](/v001/README.md) is about 95% of what you want a guitar strap to be.


## Alternatives

The main inspiration for this strap is to get a shorter strap. There are other ways you can get a shorter strap.

* Many strap manufacturers, such as Couch straps, will custom make their straps shorter. It will cost you more than the DIY strap, but they are proven designs.
* Where a normal strap folds over itself, you could take a section of it and tie it off. It might not look look very good, but everyone is going to focused on your playing.
* If you can find [Siamese Slick Clips](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/1-Siamese-Slick-Clip_p_370.html) in 2 inches, you could do the precious trick. This would probably look better. I have not been able to find a larger or smaller size for these. Maybe it could be 3D printed.
* You could cut and resew one of your existing straps.
