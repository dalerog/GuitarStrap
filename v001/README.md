# DIY Guitar Strap Version 001

This covers how to build your own guitar strap without needing a sewing machine.

Note: Sorry to have to say this, but I take no responsibility for any damage that happens to you, your guitar, or anything else as a results of this project. My straps have been great, but your straps, body and guitar are different. If, however, you end up becoming famous while wearing a strap base on these designs I will take full credit for your success and become the hit of the dog park.

## Parts

The following are the parts you are going to need:

* Paracord: ~4 feet of paracord. I used 550 paracord that I happened to have. I would support your local hardware store and buy from them. Depending on your guitar's strap pins smaller paracord might work better because it can fit tighter under the pin. Using smaller cord might require smaller cord locks.
* Webbing:  ~2 feet of 2 inch wide webbing. I think nylon webbing would be prefered, but I used [polypropolene](https://a.co/d/hPpISSm). The one I bought is more slippery than I would like. See below for more information.
* Grommets: 2 3/4 inch grommets. I bought the [combo kit](https://a.co/d/2DWDpeO) which includes the necessary tools.
* Cord Locks: I used [single slot](https://a.co/d/drngbGX) and [double slot](https://a.co/d/clO3hms).
* Velcro Cable Ties: You want to use smaller shorter ties. I borrowed some from my phone cables. Older ones can work better as they are not too grippy.

## Tools
* Grommet Tools: I bought this [combo kit](https://a.co/d/2DWDpeO).
* Soldering Iron: This is optional, but it is the way I put holes in the webbing.
* Scissors and/or knife
* Combination square, measuring Tape, and/or ruler

## Preparation

There are two main parts of the strap: the webbing and the paracord. The webbing is for comfort and only it should contact your body. The parachord is for connecting to the guitar and only it should touch the guitar. If it wasn't for comfort, the whole thing could be parachord.

This strap can be completely customized to your body, playing style, and guitar. The measurements provided here are a good starting point, but you might like things differently. I play electric quitar in the classical position and like a shorter strap. If your guitar is hitting your knees when you play, you will want something longer.

The ideal design is to have the webbing touching touching your body as it goes across your shoulder. There should be a couple of extra inches hanging off your body in the front and back. Try on your favorite guitar strap and measure where it stops touching your body. This is the measurement you want to use for the webbing. Generally, the size of this part of the strap will not change based on how lowe you wear the guitar. It should be fairly consistant. I used 2 feet for my strap. 

You need enough parachord to go from the strap to the guitar and back again. Using your favorite guitar strap as a model measure how much space you need. Add a couple of extra inches for looping the strap and tying knots. I used ~2 feet. If you wear your guitar lower this is where you should add length. 

## Steps

* Prepare the webbing
    * Cut 2 feet of webbing. This can be sized to preference

## Use



## Issues

The straps work as described above. I use this strap exclusively on one of my guitars and I'm very happy with it. However, there are a few things I would like to fix before I start using them on my other guitars.

* Slippery Webbing
* Cord locks slip
* Velcro issues

### Slippery webbing

This may be personal perference, but I fid the webbing to be a little too slippery and I have to hold the guitar in the right spot which can get tiring after a while. I have seen others make the same complaign about guitar straps you can buy that use a simular material. So, this isn't unique to this design.

The best solution would be to find a type of webbing that isn't as slippery, but I have not done this yet.

#### My solution

There are several ways to fix this issue. I ended up sewing on some non-slip fabric onto the part of the strap that goes against my body. I happened to have the fabric already, but I bought it from here: XXX.

I cut a 1.5 foot by ~2 inch section of the non-slip fabric and just sewed the two ends onto the strap. It would be better to sew the sides also, but it works fine this way. I hand sewed it and it works fine.

Some could say that this is too sticky as you can put the strap into postions where the guitar is out of balance, but it will hold in that postion. Some would say this is a feature.

#### Other solutions

* Rub in a light coat of rubber cement or epoxy. This will provide a tacky surface. I have not tried this
* Use a rubber bike innertube. You don't have to use a full strip, but just a pience to go over your shoulder. Bike inner tubes are curved and it might be hard getting a piece that is long enough. I tried this out by just putting the inner tube under the strap and it worked. I did not actually connect the two together.
* Use neoprene without a nylon cover. You could either glue or sew the neoprene. If the neoprene is thin you could just use a little on your shoulder to keep the strap from moving. Alternatively, you could use a longer piece for comfort. See the variations below for more ideas.

### Cord locks slip

The cord locks sometimes slip. It doesn't happen very often, but once is really too often. I'm looking for better locks, but haven't found them yet. My solution is to tie a knot right after the cord lock. This keeps it from moving, but makes it harder to make adjustments. You could mark the place where the cord lock is, take the lock off, and just tie it off.

### Velcro is too slippery except when its not

The velcro is problematic. 

## Variations

 * Double the webbing: Instead of using a single piece of webbing 2 foot long, cut a 4 foot piece and fold it in half. This makes the strap feel a little more solid and it doesn't flop around as much when you put it on. You basically, build it the same as before, but just put the grommets through both pieces of webbing at the same time. I did not swe the two pieces of strap together, but you could do this if you wanted to.
 * Pointed ends: As build above, the ends of the webbing will be squared off. If you wanted you can fold the ends into a point and sew them down. This would make them look a little more like traditional strap. I did not do this with mine.
 * Wider straps: Use 3" wide webbing instead of 2" wide. This should make the strap more comfortable as it is spreading the weight across a larger area. However, the strap is straight and not curved with your neck, so it might have drawbacks. I have not tried it.
 * Neoprene: Sew a piece of neoprene to the webbing. Make sure that it is not too slippery if it has a nylon cover. Alternatively, use the double strap method and put the neoprene between the webbing. This could make a very comfortable strap. I have not tried this.
 * Knots instead of locks: You can just knot the chord instead of using the chord locks. You can't adjust the strap as easily, but you might like how this looks better. It would be easier to start with the cord locks and when you know the right location, take them off and then tie the knot.
 * Trim the extra cord: If you don't like how it looks with the extra chord flopping around, you can always trim it off.
 * Knotting together: You can knot the cords together intead of just using an overhand knot at the end of each chord. You might think this looks better.
