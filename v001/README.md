# DIY Guitar Strap Version 001

This covers how to build your own guitar strap without needing a sewing machine.

## Parts

The following are the parts you are going to need:

* Paracord: ~4 feet of paracord. I used 550 paracord that I happened to have. I would support your local hardware store. Depending on your guitar's strap pins smaller paracord might work better because it can fit tighter under the pin.
* Webbing:  2 feet of webbing 2 inches wide. I think nylon webbeing would be prefered, but I used polypropolene. I bought XXX, but I would not recommend it. See reasons below.
* Grommets: 2 3/4 inchd grommets.
* Cord Locks: I used these XXX.
* Velcro Cable Ties: You want to use smaller ties. I borrowed some from my phone cables. Older ones can work better.

## Tools
* Grommet Tools: I used this one XXX. Here is an Amazon link XXX.
* Soldering Iron: This is optional, but it is the way I put holes in the webbing.
* Scissors
* Measuring Tape
* Ruler

## Variations

 * Double the webbing: Instead of using a single piece of webbing 2 foot long, cut a 4 foot piece and fold it in half. This makes the strap feel a little more solid and it doesn't flop around as much when you put it on. You basically, build it the same as before, but just put the grommets through both pieces of webbing at the same time. I did not swe the two pieces of strap together, but you could do this if you wanted to.
 * Pointed ends: As build above, the ends of the webbing will be squared off. If you wanted you can fold the ends into a point and sew them down. This would make them look a little more like traditional strap. I did not do this with mine.
 * Wider straps: Use 3" wide webbing instead of 2" wide. This should make the strap more comfortable as it is spreading the weight across a larger area. However, the strap is straight and not curved with your neck, so it might have drawbacks. I have not tried it.
