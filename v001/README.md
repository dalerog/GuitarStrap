# DIY Guitar Strap Version 001

This covers how to build your own guitar strap without needing a sewing machine.

 > [! NOTE] Note: Sorry to have to say this, but I take no responsibility for any damage that happens to you, your guitar, or anything else as a results of this project. My straps have been great, but your straps, body, and guitar are different. If, however, you end up becoming famous while wearing a strap base on these designs, I will take full credit for your success and become the hit of the dog park.

## Parts

The following are the parts you are going to need:

* Paracord: ~4 feet of paracord. I used 550 paracord that I happened to have. I would support your local hardware store and buy from them. Depending on your guitar's strap pins smaller paracord might work better because it can fit tighter under the pin. Using smaller cord might require smaller cord locks.
* Webbing:  ~2 feet of 2 inch wide webbing. I think nylon webbing would be prefered, but I used [polypropolene](https://a.co/d/hPpISSm). The one I bought is more slippery than I would like. See below for more information.
* Grommets: Two 3/8 inch grommets. I bought the [combo kit](https://a.co/d/2DWDpeO) which includes the necessary tools.
* Cord Locks: 2 cord locks. I used [single slot](https://a.co/d/drngbGX) and [double slot](https://a.co/d/clO3hms).
* ~~Velcro Cable Ties: You want to use smaller shorter ties. I borrowed some from my phone cables. Older ones can work better as they are not too grippy.~~
* Cord Wheel Locks: I ordered [these](https://a.co/d/1nYXbmL). I'm now using cord wheel locks instead of velcro. I don't have a lot of experience with them yet, so I'm leaving the notes for the velcro up.
* Felt with adhesive back: I ordered [these](https://a.co/d/hL88w3z). This is to stick onto the cord locks to ensure they don't scratch your guitar. If you are using the velcro, you can skip these.

It can be nice to use something to make it clear which end of the strap is the front end and which is the back end. Even if you cut the cord to the same length, you will find that you adjust the length of each cord slightly differntly. Making some difference between the ends will mean you don't have to adjust the strap as much. You can use different color velcro, cord, or cord locks for each end. You can tie the knocks on each end differently. You could sew or attach something to one end to make it stand out. This is just a nice to have.

## Tools
* Grommet Tools: I bought this [combo kit](https://a.co/d/2DWDpeO).
* Soldering Iron: This is optional, but it is the way I put holes in the webbing.
* Scissors and/or knife
* Combination square, measuring Tape, and/or ruler
* Lighter or headgun for melting the webbing.

## Preparation

There are two main parts of the strap: the webbing and the paracord. The webbing is for comfort and only it should contact your body. The parachord is for connecting to the guitar and only it should touch the guitar. If it wasn't for comfort, the whole thing could be parachord. 

The paracord is not permantly attached to the webbing. You can change the paracord whenever you want. So, you can have multiple colors or different lengths of cord for different quitars and use the same piece of webbing.

This strap can be completely customized to your body, playing style, and guitar. The measurements provided here are a good starting point, but you might like things differently. I play electric quitar in the classical position and like a shorter strap. If your guitar is hitting your knees when you play, you will want something longer. To make it longer you will mostly want a longer piece of paracord.

The ideal design is to have the webbing touching touching your body as it goes across your shoulder. There should be a couple of extra inches hanging off your body in the front and back. Try on your favorite guitar strap and measure where it stops touching your body. This is the measurement you want to use for the webbing. Generally, the size of this part of the strap will not change based on how lowe you wear the guitar. It should be fairly consistant. I used 2 feet for my strap. As mentioned in the variations section below, you can double the length of the webbing and fold it in half.

You need enough parachord to go from the strap to the guitar and back again. Using your favorite guitar strap as a model measure how much space you need. Add a least 6 inchesfor looping the strap and tying knots. I used ~2 feet. If you wear your guitar lower this is where you should add length. If you are unsure, you can always cut more than you need and trim it down later. 

Generally, speaking the paracord will be longer in the back than the front. There is less room between your shoulder and the front strap pin than there is between where the strap leaves your body on the back to the back strap pin.

## Steps

* Prepare the webbing
    * Cut a piece of webbing to the length you decided above. I used 2 feet of webbing.
    * Use a lighter or heat gun to melt the edges of the cut so they don't ravel.
    * Measure about an inch up from each end of the strap and make a mark in the center of the strap. This is where you are going to instaall the grommets.
    * The grommet kit above includes a tool for cutting a hole in the material. I found that I was able to use a soldering iron to make a hole. You might also be able to use a nail that you heat up with a lighter. Please be careful and try not to burn yourself. Make sure that you don't make the hole too big or the grommet won't work.
    * I used the 3/8 inch grommets from the kit. These are the smaller ones. The grommet hole just needs to be large enough for two strands of the paracord to pass through.
    * Attach the grommets per the instructions for the tools you are using.
    * If you are doubling the web, make sure to connect the two pieces of webbing with the grommet.

* Prepare the paracord
    * Cut the paracord to your desired length. It is okay to cut it longer than needed. If you hate waste like me, cut twice as much as you need and then you can cut it in half and make a second strap.
    * Use the lighter to melt the ends of the paracord. You can use pliers to flatten the melted end to make it easier to go through the cord locks.
 
   That's really all there is to this part.

* Assemble the strap
    * Fold one piece of the paracord in half.
    * Pass the cut ends of the cord hrough the grommet.
    * Insert the ends of the cord into one of the cord locks.
    * Tie an overhand knot in each cord to prevent the cord lock from going off the end.
    * On the oppostive end of the cord where it is folded, wrap the velcro around the cord about 2 inches from the fold in the cord. Keep the smooth side out so the rough side doesn't rub agaisnt your guitar.
    * If you are using the velro: Wrap the velcro around itself. The velcro has two purposes:
        * First, it is to keep the cord from being able to go through the grommet and falling off.
        * Second, it prevents the loop around the strap pin from loosening when there is no tension on it.
    * If you are using the wheel locks instead of the velcro, you want to put the loop of the cord through the wider rounded end of the lock, so it pokes out the narrower square end.
        * Now you can insert the gear in the slot on the rounded end until the little bump pops up into the slot.
        * Cut a piece of the adhesive foam that will cover the parts of the cord lock that are likely to touch your guitar.
        * Remove the paper backing and stick it to the lock.
        * It is a good idea to try the strap first to see where it is going to touch before attaching the felt.
        * I have just switched from the velcro to the wheel lock, so I'm not sure how this adhesive felt will stand up over time.
    * Now, repeat this process on the other end of the strap. Make sure that you have the cord locks on the same side of the strap for both ends. ;-)
  
If you don't do anything, both ends of the strap will look the same. There are some ideas on how to make the ends look different in the parts section.

Here is [![a video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/e4OyhcJ6KDw/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/e4OyhcJ6KDw) of showing how to assemble the strap. This video shows using the velcro and not the wheel locks.

Now it is time to use the strap.

## Use

The key to this strap is wrapping the cord around the strap pin. Don't just hang it on the pin. It can be a little confusing from the discription, so use the video.

* Take one end of the strap.
* Hold onto the end of the paracord with the velcro. This side of the strap is the inside and should face towards the guitar.
* Put the cord around the strap pin making sure you have a little extra on the end where the cord double backs.
* Twist the cord. The cord will overlap itself at the strap pin on the opposite side from the strap.
* Fit the cord back over the strap pin.
* Pull the cord tight. There are two loops of cord around the strap pin.
* Slide the velcro or wheel lock up against the strap pin.
* Now repeat for the other side.

This process is awkward at first. As you get used to it, you can do it with a single hand. I have several straps and this is my favorite one for taking off and putting on. I don't feel like I am making the strap pin hold larger everytime I attach/detack it like I do with my leather straps. If someting does go wrong with the paracord, just cut another piece. Everything else is reuseable.

Watching [![the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6bzeIvQumjw/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6bzeIvQumjw) can be very helpful.

Here are some close ups pictures of attaching the cord to the guitar. 

[![This video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OHnPxOfayp4/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OHnPxOfayp4) shows twisting the cord before folding it back over the strap pin: 

After the video the cord should be twisted like in this picture.
![View after you have twisted the cord.](/images/1-LoopTwisted.png)

Now you fold the loop back over the strap pin.

Wrap the loop around the srap pin again.

You will now pull the cord tight and then move the velcro or wheel lock up to keep it in place.


## Issues

The straps work as described above. I use this strap exclusively on one of my guitars and I'm very happy with it. However, there are a few things I would like to fix before I start using them on my other guitars.

* Slippery Webbing
* Cord locks slip
* Velcro issues which are fixed when using the wheel locks.

### Slippery webbing

This is a personal perference, but I find the webbing to be a little too slippery and I have to hold the guitar in the right spot which can get tiring after a while. I have seen others make similar complaints about guitar straps you can buy that use a simular material. So, this isn't unique to this design. It is also possible that you wouldn't even notice.

The best solution would be to find a type of webbing that isn't as slippery, but I have not done this yet.

#### My solution

There are several ways to fix this issue. I ended up sewing on some non-slip fabric onto the part of the strap that goes against my body. I happened to have the fabric already, but I bought it from [here](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/54-Bumpy-Slip-NOT-Grip-Fabric-2695-linear-yard_p_169.html).

I cut a 1.5 foot by ~2 inch section of the non-slip fabric and just sewed the two ends onto the strap. It would be better to sew the sides also, but it works fine this way. I hand sewed it and it works fine.

Some could say that this is too sticky as you can put the strap into postions where the guitar is out of balance, but it will hold in that postion. Some would say this is a feature.

#### Other solutions

* Rub in a light coat of rubber cement or epoxy. This will provide a tacky surface. I have not tried this
* Use a rubber bike innertube. You don't have to use a full strip, but just a pience to go over your shoulder. Bike inner tubes are curved and it might be hard getting a piece that is long enough. I tried this out by just putting the inner tube under the strap and it worked. I did not actually connect the two together.
* Use neoprene without a nylon cover. You could either glue or sew the neoprene. If the neoprene is thin you could just use a little on your shoulder to keep the strap from moving. Alternatively, you could use a longer piece for comfort. See the variations below for more ideas.

### Cord locks slip

The cord locks sometimes slip. It doesn't happen very often, but once is really too often. I'm looking for better locks, but haven't found them yet. My solution is to tie a knot right after the cord lock. This keeps it from moving, but makes it harder to make adjustments. You could mark the place where the cord lock is, take the lock off, and just tie it off.

I might try the wheel locks in this postion instead of the spring cord locks, but have not tried this solution yet.

### Velcro is too slippery except when its not

The velcro is problematic as it can be either too sticky to slide forward and back or too slippery. Most of the issues are solved with the wheel locks. The only issue so far with the wheel locks is whether the felt will hold up over time and prevent stratches to the guitar.

## Variations

 * Double the webbing: Instead of using a single piece of webbing 2 foot long, cut a 4 foot piece and fold it in half. This makes the strap feel a little more solid and it doesn't flop around as much when you put it on. You basically, build it the same as before, but just put the grommets through both pieces of webbing at the same time. I did not swe the two pieces of strap together, but you could do this if you wanted to.
 * Pointed ends: As build above, the ends of the webbing will be squared off. If you wanted you can fold the ends into a point and sew them down. This would make them look a little more like traditional strap. I did not do this with mine.
 * Wider straps: Use 3" wide webbing instead of 2" wide. This should make the strap more comfortable as it is spreading the weight across a larger area. However, the strap is straight and not curved with your neck, so it might have drawbacks. I have not tried it.
 * Neoprene: Sew a piece of neoprene to the webbing. Make sure that it is not too slippery if it has a nylon cover. Alternatively, use the double strap method and put the neoprene between the webbing. This could make a very comfortable strap. I have not tried this.
 * Knots instead of locks: You can just knot the chord instead of using the chord locks. You can't adjust the strap as easily, but you might like how this looks better. It would be easier to start with the cord locks and when you know the right location, take them off and then tie the knot.
 * Trim the extra cord: If you don't like how it looks with the extra chord flopping around, you can always trim it off.
 * Knotting together: You can knot the cords together intead of just using an overhand knot at the end of each chord. You might think this looks better.
